Our catsem.c implementation avoids starvation by providing a lock called
CatBlock, once the first mouse comes into wait on a dish, it blocks the cat so
that it doesn't continue to get the exclusive lock for either a cat or mouse.
Effectively this means that if a mouse is waiting, it will get priority over a
cat waiting for a dish. This is slightly less performant, because if a cat and
mouse are waiting, and one cat finishes, the other cat cant go in and eat because
there is a mouse waiting. therefore it is less efficient utilization of
resources. However this approach avoids the mouse starving, which is
preferrential.
